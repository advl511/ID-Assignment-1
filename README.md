SPCA website recreation
My project is my attempt at a user-friendly website dedicated to the mission and initiatives of the SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals). The website will serve as a plac e for people looking to learn more about animal welfare, adopt pets, and support the SPCA’s programs. It will highlight the SPCA, and offer a platform for volunteering opportunities. The site aims to engage animal lovers and raise awareness about the critical work the SPCA does to protect and care for animals in need. With an intuitive design, the website will also include easy navigation for adopting pets, educational content, and a way to keep users informed about ongoing campaigns and events.
Design Process Overview
The primary focus of this website design is to create an accessible and engaging experience for animal lovers, potential pet adopters, donors, and volunteers. We understand that the users of this site may have varying levels of familiarity with the SPCA’s mission, so our goal is to ensure the site serves as both an educational resource and an action platform. The website is designed to foster a deeper connection between users and the animals they may wish to adopt or support, as well as to make it easy for visitors to engage with the SPCA’s campaigns and programs.
